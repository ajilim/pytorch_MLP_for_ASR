# pytorch_MLP_for_ASR
This codes implements a basic MLP for speech recognition. The MLP  is trained  with pytorch, while feature extraction, alignements, and decoding are performed with Kaldi.  The current implementation supports dropout and batch normalization. An example for phoneme recognition using the standard TIMIT dataset is provided.
